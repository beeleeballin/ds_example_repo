I'm an R Markdown document! 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from
a _normal distribution_:

```{r create samp and find length}
samp = rnorm(1000)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3

Let's try the in-class assessment.

```{r my attempt at the assessment}
la_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500, mean=1),
  pos_x = x > 0,
  abs_x = abs(x)
)

ggplot(la_df, aes(x=abs_x)) + geom_histogram()

median_x = median(pull(la_df, x))
```
